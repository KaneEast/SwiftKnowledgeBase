# Observer Pattern

## Overview
The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Key Components

### Subject (Observable)
- Maintains a list of observers
- Provides methods to add and remove observers
- Notifies observers when its state changes
- Also known as Publisher or Observable

### Observer
- Defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified
- Receives notifications from the subject
- Also known as Subscriber or Listener

### Concrete Subject
- Stores state of interest to concrete observers
- Sends notification to observers when state changes
- Implements the subject interface

### Concrete Observer
- Maintains a reference to a concrete subject object
- Implements the observer updating interface
- Keeps state consistent with the subject's state

## When to Use
- When changes to one object require updating multiple objects
- When an object should notify others without knowing who they are
- When you want loose coupling between subject and observers
- For implementing event handling systems
- When you need to support broadcast communication

## Advantages
- Loose coupling between subject and observers
- Dynamic relationships (observers can be added/removed at runtime)
- Supports broadcast communication
- Follows Open/Closed Principle
- Supports multiple observers for one subject

## Disadvantages
- Observers are notified in random order
- Can cause memory leaks if observers aren't properly removed
- Can lead to unexpected update chains
- Difficult to debug complex observer hierarchies
- Performance overhead with many observers

## Common Use Cases
- Model-View architectures (MVC, MVVM)
- Event handling systems
- Notification systems
- Data binding
- Real-time data updates
- Chat applications
- Stock price monitoring
- Progress tracking

## iOS Examples
- NotificationCenter
- KVO (Key-Value Observing)
- Combine framework
- @Published and @StateObject in SwiftUI
- Delegation pattern (one-to-one observer)

## Related Patterns
- **Mediator Pattern**: Centralizes communication vs direct observation
- **Command Pattern**: Can be used to implement undo in observers
- **Singleton Pattern**: Often used for global event systems

## Example
See `ObserverPattern.swift` for practical implementations of the Observer pattern with different use cases.
