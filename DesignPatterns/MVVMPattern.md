# MVVM Pattern (Model-View-ViewModel)

## Overview
The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is an architectural design pattern that separates the development of graphical user interfaces from the business logic. It's particularly popular in modern frameworks that support data binding.

## Components

### Model
- Represents data and business logic
- Contains the application's domain logic
- Independent of the user interface
- Manages data persistence and validation

### View
- Represents the user interface
- Displays data and captures user input
- Binds to properties in the ViewModel
- Should contain minimal logic

### ViewModel
- Acts as a binding layer between View and Model
- Exposes data from Model in a format suitable for View
- Handles view-specific logic and state
- Provides commands for user interactions
- Often implements observable properties

## Key Concepts

### Data Binding
- Automatic synchronization between View and ViewModel
- Two-way binding for user input
- One-way binding for display data

### Commands
- Encapsulate user actions
- Can include validation and execution logic
- Provide enabled/disabled state

### Observable Properties
- Notify the View when data changes
- Usually implemented with property observers or reactive frameworks

## When to Use
- When you need strong separation between UI and business logic
- For complex user interfaces with lots of data binding
- When implementing testable view logic
- In applications requiring multiple views for the same data
- When using frameworks that support data binding

## Advantages
- Better testability (ViewModel can be unit tested)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Supports data binding
- Easier maintenance and code reuse
- Reduced code-behind in views
- Supports multiple views per ViewModel

## Disadvantages
- Can be overkill for simple UIs
- Learning curve for data binding concepts
- May lead to complex ViewModels
- Additional abstraction layer
- Potential performance overhead with excessive binding

## MVVM in iOS/Swift Context
- Combine framework for reactive programming
- @Published properties for observable data
- ObservableObject protocol
- Property wrappers like @StateObject and @ObservedObject in SwiftUI

## Related Patterns
- **MVC Pattern**: Simpler alternative for basic applications
- **MVP Pattern**: Similar separation but different data flow
- **Observer Pattern**: Used for implementing data binding

## Example
See `MVVMPattern.swift` for a practical implementation of MVVM pattern with mock views and data binding simulation.
