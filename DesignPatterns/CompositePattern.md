# Composite Pattern

## Overview
The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and work with these structures as if they were individual objects. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Key Components

### Component
- Declares the interface for objects in the composition
- Implements default behavior common to all classes
- Declares interface for accessing and managing child components
- Optionally defines interface for accessing a component's parent

### Leaf
- Represents leaf objects in the composition (no children)
- Defines behavior for primitive objects
- Implements the Component interface
- Cannot have children

### Composite
- Defines behavior for components having children
- Stores child components
- Implements child-related operations in the Component interface
- Usually delegates work to child components and combines results

## Key Principles

### Uniform Treatment
- Clients can treat individual objects and compositions uniformly
- Same interface for both simple and complex objects
- Simplifies client code

### Tree Structure
- Organizes objects in tree-like hierarchical structures
- Part-whole hierarchies
- Recursive composition

## When to Use
- When you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
- When you want clients to ignore differences between compositions and individual objects
- When you have tree-like object structures
- When you need to work with nested structures of varying depth
- When operations should be applied uniformly across the hierarchy

## Advantages
- Simplifies client code by treating objects uniformly
- Makes it easier to add new kinds of components
- Provides flexibility in creating complex tree structures
- Follows Open/Closed Principle
- Enables recursive algorithms naturally

## Disadvantages
- Can make your design overly general
- Can make it harder to restrict components of a composite
- May create systems where every object has the same interface
- Runtime type checking might be necessary

## Implementation Variations
- **Transparent Composite**: Component interface includes child management methods
- **Safe Composite**: Only Composite has child management methods
- **Cached Composite**: Caches results for performance
- **Flyweight Composite**: Combines with Flyweight pattern for memory efficiency

## Common Use Cases
- File system structures (files and directories)
- GUI component hierarchies (windows, panels, buttons)
- Organizational structures (employees, departments)
- Mathematical expressions (operands and operators)
- Menu systems (menus and menu items)
- Document structures (paragraphs, sections, documents)

## Design Considerations
- Decide whether to make child management operations part of Component interface
- Consider ordering of children if it matters
- Handle parent references if needed
- Implement caching for performance if operations are expensive
- Consider memory usage for large hierarchies

## Related Patterns
- **Iterator Pattern**: Often used to traverse composite structures
- **Visitor Pattern**: Can apply operations to composite structures
- **Decorator Pattern**: Similar structure but different intent
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Can be combined for memory optimization

## Example
