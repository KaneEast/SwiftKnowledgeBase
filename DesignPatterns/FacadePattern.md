# Facade Pattern

## Overview
The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by hiding the complexities of the subsystem from clients.

## Key Components

### Facade
- Provides a simple interface to the complex subsystem
- Delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects
- May perform additional logic before/after delegating
- Shields clients from subsystem complexity

### Subsystem Classes
- Implement the actual functionality
- Handle work assigned by the Facade
- Have no knowledge of the Facade
- Can be used directly by clients if needed

### Client
- Uses the Facade instead of calling subsystem objects directly
- Benefits from simplified interface
- Remains decoupled from subsystem complexity

## Key Principles

### Simplification
- Provides a simple interface to complex operations
- Reduces the number of objects clients need to interact with
- Combines multiple subsystem calls into single operations

### Encapsulation
- Hides subsystem complexity from clients
- Encapsulates the knowledge of which subsystem objects handle which requests
- Provides a buffer between clients and subsystem implementation

## When to Use
- When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
- When there are many dependencies between clients and implementation classes
- When you want to layer subsystems
- When you need to wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs
- When you want to reduce coupling between subsystems and clients

## Advantages
- Simplifies the interface to complex subsystems
- Promotes loose coupling between subsystems and clients
- Provides a single entry point to subsystem functionality
- Makes the subsystem easier to use and understand
- Allows for easier maintenance and testing
- Shields clients from subsystem changes

## Disadvantages
- Can become a god object if it tries to do too much
- May add an unnecessary layer of abstraction
- Clients may need direct access to subsystem features not exposed by facade
- Can limit flexibility if the facade is too restrictive

## Facade vs Other Patterns
- **Adapter**: Changes interface vs Facade which simplifies interface
- **Mediator**: Facilitates communication vs Facade which provides access
- **Proxy**: Controls access vs Facade which simplifies access

## Common Use Cases
- API wrappers and SDKs
- Database access layers
- File system operations
- Network communication libraries
- Complex initialization sequences
- Legacy system integration
- Third-party library integration

## Implementation Variations
- **Simple Facade**: Basic wrapper around subsystem
- **Complex Facade**: Adds business logic and coordination
- **Layered Facade**: Multiple levels of abstraction
- **Pluggable Facade**: Supports different subsystem implementations

## Related Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**: Both provide interface adaptation
- **Mediator Pattern**: Both reduce coupling between objects
- **Abstract Factory**: Can work together to create subsystem objects
- **Singleton Pattern**: Facade is often implemented as singleton

## Example
