# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## Overview
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. When receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Key Components

### Handler Protocol
- Defines the interface for handling requests
- Implements the default chaining behavior
- Usually contains a method to set the next handler

### Concrete Handler
- Handles requests it's responsible for
- Can access the next handler in the chain
- Decides whether to handle the request or pass it on

### Client
- Initiates the request to any handler in the chain
- Doesn't need to know which handler will process the request

## Key Principles

### Chain Structure
- Handlers are linked in a chain
- Each handler has a reference to the next handler
- Request flows through the chain until handled

### Decoupling
- Sender doesn't know which object will handle the request
- Handlers don't know about each other's existence
- Dynamic chain composition

## When to Use
- When multiple objects can handle a request and the handler isn't known beforehand
- When you want to issue a request to several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly
- When you want to decouple request senders from receivers
- When the set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically
- When you want to pass requests along a chain of processing objects

## Advantages
- Reduces coupling between sender and receiver
- Adds flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects
- Allows adding or removing responsibilities dynamically
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle
- Follows Open/Closed Principle

## Disadvantages
- Request processing isn't guaranteed
- Can be hard to observe runtime characteristics
- Can impact performance due to chain traversal
- Debugging can be difficult with long chains

## Chain Variations
- **Linear Chain**: Simple sequential chain
- **Tree Chain**: Hierarchical chain structure
- **Composite Chain**: Combined with Composite pattern
- **Priority Chain**: Handlers with priority levels

## Common Use Cases
- Event handling systems (GUI events, DOM events)
- Logging systems with different log levels
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Help systems
- Error handling and exception processing
- Request processing pipelines
- Middleware in web frameworks
- Approval workflows

## Implementation Considerations
- Decide on chain ordering carefully
- Consider performance implications of long chains
- Handle cases where no handler processes the request
- Provide a way to break the chain if needed
- Consider using abstract base class vs protocol

## Related Patterns
- **Composite Pattern**: Can be combined for tree-like structures
- **Decorator Pattern**: Similar structure but different intent
- **Command Pattern**: Can be used to send requests through chain
- **Observer Pattern**: Different notification mechanism

## Example
