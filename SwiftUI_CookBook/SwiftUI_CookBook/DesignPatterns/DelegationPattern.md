# Delegation Pattern

## Overview
The Delegation pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows one object to delegate specific responsibilities to another object. It's widely used in iOS development and provides a way to customize behavior without subclassing.

## Key Concepts

### Delegate
- An object that receives and handles messages from another object
- Implements methods defined in a protocol
- Provides custom behavior for specific events or operations

### Delegating Object
- The object that sends messages to its delegate
- Maintains a weak reference to the delegate to avoid retain cycles
- Calls delegate methods at appropriate times

### Protocol
- Defines the methods that the delegate can implement
- Usually contains optional methods to provide flexibility
- Establishes a contract between the delegating object and delegate

## When to Use
- When you want to customize behavior without subclassing
- To implement callbacks and event handling
- When multiple objects need to respond to the same events differently
- For loose coupling between components
- In UI components that need custom behavior

## Advantages
- Promotes loose coupling between objects
- Enables customization without inheritance
- Supports multiple delegates (with some modifications)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Flexible and reusable code

## Disadvantages
- Can lead to fragmented code logic
- Potential for retain cycles if not handled properly
- May be harder to trace execution flow
- Requires understanding of protocols

## Common Use Cases in iOS
- UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource
- Custom view controllers communicating with parent controllers
- Network layer callbacks
- Custom UI component event handling

## Example
See `DelegationPattern.swift` for a practical implementation of the Delegation pattern.
