# Multicast Delegate Pattern

## Overview
The Multicast Delegate pattern is an extension of the traditional Delegate pattern that allows multiple objects to observe and respond to events from a single source. Unlike the standard delegation pattern which typically involves a one-to-one relationship, multicast delegation enables a one-to-many relationship.

## Key Components

### Multicast Delegate
- Maintains a list of delegates
- Provides methods to add and remove delegates
- Notifies all registered delegates when events occur
- Handles delegate lifecycle management

### Delegate Protocol
- Defines the interface that all delegates must implement
- Specifies the methods that will be called on delegates
- Usually contains optional methods for flexibility

### Concrete Delegates
- Implement the delegate protocol
- Receive notifications from the multicast delegate
- Can be added or removed at runtime

## Key Differences from Standard Delegation
- **Standard Delegate**: One-to-one relationship
- **Multicast Delegate**: One-to-many relationship
- **Standard Delegate**: Single delegate property
- **Multicast Delegate**: Collection of delegates

## When to Use
- When multiple objects need to respond to the same events
- When you want to decouple event sources from multiple observers
- For implementing custom notification systems
- When standard delegation is too limiting
- For broadcasting events to multiple listeners

## Advantages
- Supports multiple observers for a single event source
- Loose coupling between event source and observers
- Dynamic subscription/unsubscription
- More flexible than standard delegation
- Can implement different notification strategies

## Disadvantages
- More complex than standard delegation
- Potential memory management issues if delegates aren't properly removed
- Notification order is not guaranteed
- Debugging can be more difficult with multiple delegates
- Performance overhead with many delegates

## Implementation Considerations
- Use weak references to avoid retain cycles
- Provide thread-safe operations if needed
- Consider notification order if it matters
- Handle delegate removal gracefully
- Consider using protocols with optional methods

## Common Use Cases
- Event broadcasting systems
- UI component notifications
- Network status updates
- Progress tracking with multiple listeners
- Custom notification centers
- Game event systems

## Memory Management
- Use weak references for delegates to prevent retain cycles
- Automatically remove deallocated delegates
- Provide explicit removal methods
- Consider using NSHashTable for automatic cleanup

## Related Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Similar concept but different implementation
- **Notification Center**: System-level implementation of similar concept
- **Publisher-Subscriber**: Similar many-to-many communication
- **Standard Delegation**: One-to-one version of this pattern
