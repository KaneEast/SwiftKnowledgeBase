# Singleton Pattern

## Overview
The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It's one of the most commonly used (and sometimes misused) design patterns.

## Key Characteristics
- **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class can exist
- **Global Access**: Provides a global access point to the instance
- **Lazy Initialization**: Instance is typically created when first accessed
- **Thread Safety**: Must handle concurrent access properly

## Implementation Details
- Private constructor/initializer to prevent external instantiation
- Static method or property to access the single instance
- Static variable to hold the instance
- Thread-safe implementation to handle concurrent access

## When to Use
- When exactly one instance of a class is needed
- For managing shared resources (database connections, file managers)
- For configuration objects
- For logging services
- For cache management
- When you need global state management

## Advantages
- Controlled access to the sole instance
- Reduced memory footprint (only one instance)
- Global access point
- Lazy initialization saves resources
- Can be extended to control the number of instances

## Disadvantages
- Can introduce global state and coupling
- Difficult to unit test (hard to mock)
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- Can become a bottleneck in multi-threaded applications
- Makes code less flexible and harder to extend
- Can hide dependencies in code

## Thread Safety Considerations
- Use `dispatch_once` or `static let` in Swift for thread safety
- Avoid lazy initialization patterns that aren't thread-safe
- Consider using serial queues for mutable singleton state

## Common Use Cases in iOS
- UserDefaults
- FileManager
- URLSession.shared
- NotificationCenter.default
- Application configuration
- Network managers
- Database managers

## Alternatives to Consider
- Dependency injection
- Factory patterns
- Static methods/properties
- Environment objects in SwiftUI
