# Coordinator Pattern With Router

## Overview
The Coordinator pattern is an architectural pattern that separates navigation logic from view controllers, promoting better separation of concerns and making navigation flows more testable and reusable. When combined with a Router, it provides a comprehensive solution for managing complex navigation hierarchies and deep linking in iOS applications.

## Key Components

### Coordinator Protocol
- Defines the interface for all coordinators
- Usually includes methods like `start()`, `coordinate(to:)`, and navigation methods
- Manages the flow of the application or a specific feature

### Concrete Coordinator
- Implements the coordinator protocol
- Manages a specific flow or feature area
- Creates and presents view controllers
- Handles navigation between screens
- Can contain child coordinators for sub-flows

### Router
- Handles the actual navigation mechanics
- Abstracts UIKit navigation methods
- Provides a consistent interface for different navigation types
- Can handle deep linking and URL routing

### View Controller
- Focuses purely on view logic and user interaction
- Has no knowledge of navigation logic
- Communicates with coordinator through delegation or callbacks

## Coordinator Types

### Application Coordinator
- Root coordinator that manages the entire app flow
- Handles authentication state, onboarding, main app flow
- Coordinates between major app sections

### Feature Coordinator
- Manages a specific feature or user flow
- Examples: Login flow, Settings flow, Shopping cart flow
- Can be reused across different parts of the app

### Tab Coordinator
- Manages tab-based navigation
- Creates and manages coordinators for each tab
- Handles tab switching logic

## Router Responsibilities

### Navigation Management
- Presents, pushes, and dismisses view controllers
- Handles modal presentations and custom transitions
- Manages navigation stack state

### Deep Linking
- Parses URLs and routes to appropriate coordinators
- Handles universal links and URL schemes
- Manages navigation state restoration

### Transition Management
- Provides consistent transition animations
- Handles custom transitions between screens
- Manages presentation contexts

## When to Use
- In complex iOS applications with multiple navigation flows
- When you need better testability for navigation logic
- When implementing deep linking and universal links
- For apps with multiple user flows (authentication, onboarding, main app)
- When you want to decouple view controllers from navigation logic

## Advantages
- Separates navigation logic from view controllers
- Makes navigation flows more testable
- Promotes reusability of view controllers
- Easier to implement deep linking
- Cleaner architecture with better separation of concerns
- Facilitates better unit testing
- Supports complex navigation hierarchies

## Disadvantages
- Adds additional architectural complexity
- Can be overkill for simple applications
- Requires team understanding of the pattern
- More boilerplate code initially
- Learning curve for developers new to the pattern

## Implementation Variations
- **Simple Coordinator**: Basic navigation management
- **Coordinator with Router**: Separates navigation mechanics
- **Flow Coordinator**: Manages specific user flows
- **Hierarchical Coordinators**: Parent-child coordinator relationships

## Deep Linking Integration
- URL parsing and route matching
- Parameter extraction from URLs
- Navigation to specific app states
- Handling of universal links and custom URL schemes

## Common Use Cases
- Multi-step onboarding flows
- Authentication and registration flows
- E-commerce checkout processes
- Settings and configuration screens
- Tab-based applications
- Modal flows with multiple screens

## Testing Benefits
- Navigation logic can be unit tested
- Mock routers for testing coordinator behavior
- Isolated testing of individual flows
- Better test coverage for navigation scenarios

## Related Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating view controllers
- **Observer Pattern**: For coordinator communication
- **State Pattern**: For managing navigation states
- **Command Pattern**: For encapsulating navigation actions
