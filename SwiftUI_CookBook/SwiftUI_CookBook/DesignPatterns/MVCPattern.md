# MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)

## Overview
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is an architectural design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps organize code and promotes reusability and maintainability.

## Components

### Model
- Represents the data and business logic
- Manages the state of the application
- Independent of the user interface
- Notifies observers when data changes

### View
- Represents the user interface (UI)
- Displays data from the model
- Handles user input and forwards it to the controller
- Should be passive and not contain business logic

### Controller
- Acts as an intermediary between Model and View
- Handles user input from the view
- Updates the model based on user actions
- Updates the view when the model changes

## When to Use
- Large applications with complex user interfaces
- When you need clear separation of concerns
- When multiple views need to display the same data
- When you want to make views and models reusable

## Advantages
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to test individual components
- Promotes code reusability
- Multiple views can share the same model
- Easier maintenance and debugging

## Disadvantages
- Can be overkill for simple applications
- Requires more initial setup
- Controller can become bloated (Massive View Controller problem)
- Learning curve for beginners

## SwiftUI Context
In SwiftUI, MVC can be implemented using:
- **Model**: Data structures and business logic classes
- **View**: SwiftUI views that observe the model
- **Controller**: Often combined with the model using ObservableObject

## Example
See `MVCPattern.swift` for a practical implementation of MVC pattern in SwiftUI.
